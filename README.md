📊 Data Pipeline & Visualization using Python and its libraries
🔹 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a mini data pipeline starting from raw files to generating insights and visualizations. It covers:

Reading and processing CSV, JSON, and TXT files.

Using NumPy for efficient array operations.

Cleaning and analyzing structured data with Pandas.

Plotting with Matplotlib (line plots, basic charts).

Enhancing plots using Seaborn (styling, themes, advanced charts).

📂 Files in this Project

output.csv → Tabular dataset.

output.json → Structured data:

{
  "name": ["Ram", "shyam", "Ramshyam"],
  "age": [10, 20, 30],
  "city": ["indore", "bhopal", "pune"]
}


practice.txt → Raw text data containing numbers:

1,2,6,87,98


line_plot.png → A line plot generated from sample data.

📈 Visualization Example

Generated plot:

X-axis → Data points.

Y-axis → Corresponding values.

Created using Matplotlib for plotting and Seaborn for styling.
